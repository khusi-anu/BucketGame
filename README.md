# BucketGame
Bucket Game is a familiar logical game. 
Let me introduce to this game. 
We are provided three buckets, one of 8 litres , 5 litres and 3 litres each.
We are to fill anyone bucket prior starting the game.
Our objective is to make 4 litres in two of the buckets.
You have to transfer the contents from one bucket to another by providing their names.for eg, to transfer contents from A to B, you have to write A B.
A space between the names of the bucket in the input is mandatory.
Here is my code for the bucket game. I have used Python 3.5 to implement this game.
Hope you like it.
